## Time Tracker [Working Title]

### Description
This program allows users to keep better track of their time and helps them make time for the things they want to, but can never find the time to, do. Each user is able to make an account to save their activities and progress. Upon starting the desired time interval, typically a week, the user has the opportunity to add various activities that they value and know they want to put time into. After setting the activities and choosing a total amount of time to spend on it over the specified time interval, a progress bar will be created for each unique activity. As time progresses, the user is able to add or subtract time from their progress while viewing a live representation of how close to their goal they are.

The idea behind this program was helping people make time for things they love. In a constantly on-the-go environment, it can be difficult to find time to relax or do activities that may be seen as less productive (i.e. not relating directly to the work in the traditional sense). The idea here is that if you decide beforehand that leisure activities, such as knitting and gardening, are worth your time and important to you, there will be less feelings of guilt or slacking off for not constantly being “productive”. Working with the assumption that most people are busy and have changing schedules from week to week, instead of having a system where you have to designate every week, this flexible system works with any schedule no matter how dynamic it is.
