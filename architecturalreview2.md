# Architectural Review 2
##### Software Design, Spring 2018
##### Anna Griffin and Luis F. Zuniga


### Goal:
Now that we have made more progress on our project, our focus for this architectural review has shifted a bit. At this point in our progress, we think that it would be most beneficial for us to get outside input on some technical obstacles we have encountered or predict we will encounter. Also, as we continue designing, it would be beneficial to have some user feedback since one of our original goals was to create a practical program. Overall, we are hoping to get advice from our peers regarding next steps and new directions that we should explore, or complications that we should avoid.

## Background and context
#### What information about your project does the audience need to participate fully in the technical review? You should share enough to make sure your audience understands the questions you are asking, but without going into unnecessary detail.


We are creating a web app that can be used to keep track of the time spent on activities throughout a week. We both noticed that it is a challenge to find time to do activities we enjoy that are separate from work in the traditional sense. This app aims to provide an easy way to help users make sure that they make time for the activities they love. In a constant on-the-go society, it is easy to feel like you’re “slacking off” if you’re not working around the clock. And there's usually a pressure to feel productive that causes a need to work all of the time, which is unhealthy. And, ironically, you'd be more productive if you took breaks. We believe that if you create a list of things that you think are worth your time, you will be more inclined to set aside time for these activities during the week, and the feeling of guilt or lack of productivity will be reduced or done away with. When a user interacts with the app, they will be able to add activities and set goals easily. In addition, they will be able to update their progress with just one click and see a live update of their time distribution.



## Key questions
#### What do you want to learn from the review? What are the most important decisions your team is currently contemplating? Where might an outside perspective be most helpful? As you select key questions to ask during the review, bear in mind both the time limitations and background of your audience.
At this stage of the project, the following are our key questions:
1. What is the best way to store our activities so that they are attached to a specific user, time, and amount of progress?
2. What is the best way to go about integrating the sign in system we have now and the activities database?
3. How, and to what extent, do we focus on security problems?
4. What are pieces of advice that can be given about the layout of our webapp to make it the most user friendly?
5. Do you think we will be limited by the data we collect? What kind of visual will we be able to create with the small segment of people’s lives we will have data on?
6. Do you have any advice on what to be thinking about if we want to try to experiment with web development and use heroku?



## Agenda for technical review session
#### Be specific about how you plan to use your allotted time. What strategies will you use to communicate with your audience?
Step 1: Reintroduce the project
Step 2: Present what we have accomplished thus far [i.e. the html pages and databases].
Step 3: Introduce next steps
Step 4: Ask the questions [on the slide]
Step 5: Lead a feedback discussion.


## Feedback form
#### Create a Google form that folks in the review will use to provide you with feedback or answers to various questions you pose to your audience. Since, at least for the first review, the time you have to present will be very short you should expect most of the feedback you get to come from this form rather than thoughts expressed orally during your session. Please submit a link to your Google form using this other Google form! (you must have this submitted no less than 2 hours before class so we have time to post a link on the course website).
