# Architectural Review
##### Software Design, Spring 2018
##### Anna Griffin and Luis F. Zuniga


### Goal:
We would like to take advantage of this opportunity by getting feedback regarding our ideas for the code structure and the usefulness of this app design. At the moment, we are both trying to become more comfortable with Flask and implement basic versions of the features we want to include. We are getting more familiar with new aspects of programming and getting a sense of what we need to do down the road. While designing, it is important to us that we keep the user in mind. One of our main goals was to design an app to help people, so as we continue throughout the development of this app, we want to make sure we stick to that and listen to potential users’ thoughts.

## Background and context
#### What information about your project does the audience need to participate fully in the technical review? You should share enough to make sure your audience understands the questions you are asking, but without going into unnecessary detail.


We are designing a productivity web app that focuses on time management and helps the user visualize their time. When interacting with the app, the user is able to input a list of activities and an amount of time they want to designate to that task over a specified time interval. Over the course of the time interval, the user will be able to update their progress for eah goal which will be displayed visually. The progress data will be supplemented with a visualization of how they are spending their time as a whole. The goal of this project is to help people who want to spend more time doing things they enjoy by minimizing the constant pressure to always be doing work in order to feel productive. By deciding beforehand a list of things you want to spend your time doing, our hope is that then you will be more inclined to set aside time for these activities.

## Key questions
#### What do you want to learn from the review? What are the most important decisions your team is currently contemplating? Where might an outside perspective be most helpful? As you select key questions to ask during the review, bear in mind both the time limitations and background of your audience.
1. At this stage of the project, the following are our key questions:
2. Are there any features that we’ve discussed that seem outside the scope of the project?
3. Are there any features that we did not discuss that seem important to our project vision?
4. What appear to be the toughest parts of this project?
5/Do you see any points that could be cool opportunities for ourselves to push our current programming knowledge?


## Agenda for technical review session
#### Be specific about how you plan to use your allotted time. What strategies will you use to communicate with your audience?
  Step 1: Introduce the project vision/idea.
  Step 2: Talk about the features of the WebApp and walk through visual aid
  Step 3: Ask for feedback about whether some main features should be reach goals
  Step 4: Ask if there are any functions that seem like they may be unnecessary or redundant?
  Step 5: Ask users how they would interact with the app and if they think it would be of any use to them


## Feedback form
#### Create a Google form that folks in the review will use to provide you with feedback or answers to various questions you pose to your audience. Since, at least for the first review, the time you have to present will be very short you should expect most of the feedback you get to come from this form rather than thoughts expressed orally during your session. Please submit a link to your Google form using this other Google form! (you must have this submitted no less than 2 hours before class so we have time to post a link on the course website).
